# GmailSearch App

This is a sample Java application built on Google AppEngine. The user (after having logged in) can search his gmail for messages in the same way he could do it inside gmail. The app stores these searches and results (the message id, the sender and a snippet) in the datastore. The user can also check his/her previous searches.

The UI is very primitive, but gets the job done as a sample application.
